# Document outputs
#   Define as many outputs here as you need. Available drivers by
#   default are 'html', which you can use as many times as you want.
#

#   use) and "path" (the directory where the output documents will be put in,
#   relative to where this config file is)
#
output:
  
  - driver: "html"
    path: "doc"
    template: "default"
  - driver: "serial"
  
# Source paths
#   Defines where the sources are. Relative paths are resolved from where
#   this config file lies in. This can be in defined as an array for multiple
#   paths. (e.x.: src_path: [src, www])
#
src_path: .
