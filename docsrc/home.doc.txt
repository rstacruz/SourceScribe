## What is SourceScribe?

  SourceScribe is a documentation-generation tool which takes your formatted
  source code comments and creates a full heirarchal manual in HTML or PDF,
  like this one you're viewing now.

  It is written in PHP and is ran from the command line. Being written in PHP,
  it has very little requirements: it can run on any OS that supports PHP4
  (Mac, Linux, Windows) and requires no other libraries.

  This is the manual for SourceScribe version 0.0 and 0.1 series. 

Downloading:

  You may download the latest version of SourceScribe from [SourceScribe's
  github page][gh]. If you have **git** installed, you may also do a pull of the
  latest sources from the tree. Simply type:

    git pull git@github.com:rstacruz/SourceScribe.git

  [gh]: http://github.com/rstacruz/SourceScribe/

See it in action:

  This site that you're looking at now is generated by SourceScribe, generated
  from the actual SourceScribe source tree! You're looking at the very output
  of SourceScribe.

Installation:

  Before you can use SourceScribe, you must first install the `ss` command.

<tr><td>
<h4>Installation method (Win/Mac/Linux):</h4>
<ol>
<li>Unzip the entire package somewhere (maybe <code>c:\Program Files\SourceScribe</code>
or <code>~/sourcescribe/</code>).</li>
<li>Add that path in your PATH statement. </li>
</ol>

<h4>Installation method (MacOS/Linux):</h4>
<ol>
<li>Unzip the entire package somewhere (maybe <code>c:\Program Files\SourceScribe</code>
or <code>~/sourcescribe/</code>).</li>
<li>Make a symbolic link to the file <code>ss</code> in a directory that's in your PATH statement.<br />
     Example for Mac/Linux: <code>sudo ln -s `pwd`/ss /usr/local/bin/ss</code></li>
</ol>

## Rock on!

  Once you've installed SourceScribe, you are now ready to generate your
  configuration, document your code, and generate your first documentation
  manual.

Continue:
  Next: [[Configuration]] &rarr;

*//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////*

Page: Configuration
[Grouped under "Getting started"]

Starting up:

  For SourceScribe to work on your code, it must first have a configuration file.

  To begin, type `ss makeconfig` in your project folder. This will create a bare
  configuration file `sourcescribe.conf` with defaults that you can edit to
  your needs. After you've done this (and documented your codebase of course),
  you can simply type `ss` to generate your documentation.

  When running `ss`, SourceScribe will look for this `sourcescribe.conf` file.
  SourceScribe will check in the current folder and it's parent folders, so you
  may call `ss` anywhere inside your source tree.

File format:

  The configuration file is in YAML format, which is a simple format for
  defining key/value pairs and arrays.
  
  For more information on this file format, see the [YAML in 5 minutes][l1]
  tutorial, the [YAML Wikipedia entry][l2], or the official [YAML site][l3].

  [l1]: http://yaml.kwiki.org/?YamlInFiveMinutes
  [l2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML
  [l3]: http://www.yaml.org


Creating your config file:

  In the command line, change to the directory of your project and type
  `ss makeconfig`. This will output a sample `sourcescribe.conf` for you
  to edit to your needs.

Sample file:
  
  Here's a sample file with bare options:  

    # My sourcescribe.conf file
    # Lines starting with pound signs are ignored as comments.
    
    name: My Project
    output:                   # Output is an array of key-value pairs
     - driver: "html"
       path: "doc/"
       template: "default"
     - driver: "pdf"
       path: "pdf/"
    exclude:                  # Exclude is an array.
     - \.svn$
     - \.git$

Another sample:

  The only required options are `name` and `output`. This is also
  a valid configuration file: 

    # sourcescribe.conf
    name: My project
    output: [{ driver: "html", path: "doc/" }]

Required options:

  name
  : The project name. This will be the title of the entire documentation.

    > <code>name: My API reference</code>
   
    A home page for your manual may be created by defining a page with the
    same name listed here.

  output
  : The outputs to spit out. This is an array of key-value pairs, each pair
    requiring a *driver*, and a *path* to define where the output will be
    saved to.

    > <code>output:  
    > - driver: "html"  
    > &nbsp; template: "default"  
    > &nbsp; path: "doc/"</code>

    Currently only the *html* driver is supported. Plugins may give more
    driver types (e.g., *pdf*, *latex*, etc). Additional templates for
    the *html* driver may be added: see *templates_path* (not yet implemented)


More options:

  src_path
  : The path where the source files are. In this example, SourceScribe will scan
    the *doc* folder (under where the configuration file resides): 

    > <code>src_path: doc</code>

   Multiple paths may also be defined using an array.

    > <code>src_path:  
    > &nbsp; - src  
    > &nbsp; - include</code>

  exclude
  : An array of regex patterns to match filenames against.
    Any file that matches will not be parsed. In this example below,
    SourceScribe will skip files under the folders *.svn*, *.git*, and *cache*:  

    > <code>exclude:  
    > &nbsp; - \.svn/  
    > &nbsp; - \.git/  
    > &nbsp; - /cache/</code>
  
  block_types
  : Add your own block types, or modify built-in types (...)

    > <code>block_types:  
    > &nbsp; ... # it's complicated</code>

  reset_block_types
  : This will remove all the built-in block types defined so you may define
    your own. Use this in conjunction with *block_types*. (...)

    > <code>reset_block_types: true</code>
  
  tags
  : Adds more project-wide tags. (...)

    > <code>tags:  
    > &nbsp; - write-only  
    > &nbsp; - unimplemented  
    > &nbsp; - in debate</code>
  
  reset_tags
  : This will remove all the built-in tag types defined so you may define
    your own. Use this in conjunction with *tags*.

    > <code>reset_tags: true</code>

    This option will clear only the project-wide tags. It will not clear the
    tag types in each block type.
  
  tag_synonyms
  : Sets up synonyms for tags. (...)

    > <code>tag_synonyms:  
    > &nbsp; write-only: [ writeonly, no-read, wo ]  
    > &nbsp; unimplemented: [ not done ]</code>
  
  include
  : File types to include. This is an array of regex patterns. Defining this
    option will override all defaults, so be sure to include here all filetypes
    that your project uses. In the example below, this will make SourceScribe
    scan *php3* and *php4* file types: 
    
    > <code>include:  
    > &nbsp; - \\.php3$  
    > &nbsp; - \\.php4$</code>
    
    If you have a plugin that provides an alternate reader, you can define which
    reader to use for each file type.
    
    > <code>include:    
    > &nbsp; \\.php3$: default  
    > &nbsp; \\.php4$: default</code>

  templates_path
  : (To be implemented) additional path to look for templates in

    > <code>templates_path: templates/     # not implemented!</code>

  plugins_path
  : (To be implemented) path to look for plugins in

    > <code>plugins_path: ssplugins/     # not implemented!</code>

For block types:
  Every `block_types` entry can have any of these options.
  Note that *all* of them are optional.

  has_brief        - .
  title_plural     - .
  parent_in_id     - .
  starts_group_for - .
  block_class      - .
  title_prefix     - .
  title_suffix     - .
  tags             - .
  short            - .
  synonyms         - .
