SourceScribe
============

This readme sucks and will be improved later on, I promise.

To install
----------

 - Place all these files somewhere (maybe /usr/local/share/sourcescribe)
 - Edit 'ss' to point to that location
 - Copy 'ss' to a bin folder like /usr/local/bin

To use
------

 - Type 'ss' in the SourceScribe directory. This will build the SourceScribe
   documentation in doc/.

 - To use in your projects, document your functions like the sourcescribe src,
   and put the sourcescribe.conf somewhere and edit it
